    What do frogs do?
    <h3> 
      <p> Frogs are amphibians and therefore many people think that all frogs live by ponds or wetlands. This is actually not true! Many adult frogs live in woodlands or grassy areas and only return to ponds to breed each year. To stay moist or wet, frogs try to find damp spaces to hide, like underneath leaves, logs, rocks or piles of debris.
